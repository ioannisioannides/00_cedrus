name: CodeQL Security Scan
# ==============================================================================
# IMPORTANT: GitHub's default CodeQL setup MUST be disabled for this workflow
# to function correctly. CodeQL analyses from advanced configurations cannot be
# processed when the default setup is enabled.
#
# To disable default setup:
# 1. Go to Settings → Code security and analysis
# 2. Under "Code scanning", if "CodeQL analysis" shows as "Enabled"
# 3. Click "..." (dropdown menu) → Select "Disable CodeQL" or "Remove"
# 4. Confirm the action
#
# To verify it's disabled:
# - Go to Settings → Code security and analysis
# - "Code scanning" section should show "Set up" (not "Enabled")
# - Only this advanced workflow should be running
