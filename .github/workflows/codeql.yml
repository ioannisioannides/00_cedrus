name: CodeQL Security Scan
# ==============================================================================
# IMPORTANT: GitHub's default CodeQL setup MUST be disabled for this workflow
# to function correctly. CodeQL analyses from advanced configurations cannot be
# processed when the default setup is enabled.
#
# To disable default setup:
# 1. Go to Settings → Code security and analysis
# 2. Under "Code scanning", if "CodeQL analysis" shows as "Enabled"
# 3. Click "Disable" or "Configure" → Switch to "Advanced"
